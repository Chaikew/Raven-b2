# **Raven b2** deobfuscated

## Warning ⚠️:
> This repo is for educational purposes only. I am NOT responsible for ANY consequences of it use/distribute !

## Time taken :
5 hours of remapping, 30min of bugfixing

## Summary :
Raven b2 is a FORGE 1.8.9 ghost client !
Disguised as a keystroke mod (/keystroke is functionnal)

## Note :
Some var names still obfuscated but code can be compiled/executed without any error (under java 8)
Some hacks CAN NOT work in "Dev env" (due to Minecraft's fields/funcs obfuscation)

Some classes may NOT be like originals (I refactored the code) !
