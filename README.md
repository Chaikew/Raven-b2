> CODE DECOMPILED with Procyon v0.5.36

## **Raven b2** deobfuscated
5 hours of remapping, 30min of bugfixing

> Raven b2 is a FORGE 1.8.9 ghost client !
> Disguised as a keystroke mod (/keystroke is functionnal)
---

> Some var names still obfuscated but code can be compiled/executed without any error (under java 8)
> Some hacks CAN NOT work in "Dev env" (due to Minecraft's fields/funcs obfuscation)

> Some classes may NOT be like originals (I refactored the code) !
